# Pytorch_Chatbot_Tutorial_Code
Followed this tutorial and implemented my part with a few changes: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/chatbot_tutorial.html

To run, download, add the path to your file in the corpus and corpus_name variables and run all cells. You can add a relative systems 
path to make the code easier to use in the future. 
You need to have "torch" installed in your virtual environment as well as python 3.8. This has been mainly inspired by a PyTorch tutorial, all the credit goes to the company!

Have a wonderful day, everyone!
